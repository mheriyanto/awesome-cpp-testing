## Assertions

- Bla-bla.

## Code Coverage

- [Bullseye Coverage](https://www.bullseye.com/whatsNew.html#8_13) - is a code analyzer for C and C++ that evaluates how much of your source code was tested.
- [FrogLogic Coco](https://doc.froglogic.com/squish-coco/latest) - Coco tests code coverage for C, C++, C# and Tcl code.
- [Intel C++ Compiler 15.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/documentation.html) - displays dynamic execution counts for each basic block of the application, provides differential coverage data, and presents code coverage information visually with a customizable coloring scheme.
- [Testwell CTC++](https://www.testwell.fi/ctcdesc.html) - is a code coverage tool for C, C+, Java, and C#.

## Design by Contract

- Bla-bla.

## Load Testing

- [Parasoft Jtest](https://parasoft.force.com) - provides a suite of testing tools for a variety of purposes like load testing, security testing, and more.

## Mock and Stub

- [CppUTest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest) - unit testing and mocking framework for C/C++.
- [mockcpp](https://github.com/sinojelly/mockcpp) - a jmock-like generic C/C++ Mock Framework, which doesn't use complex template technique which will result in very heavy compiling overhead.

## Mutation Testing

- Bla-bla.

## Object Factories

- Bla-bla.

## Penetration Testing

- Bla-bla.

## Performance Testing

- [sltbench](https://github.com/ivafanas/sltbench) - C++ benchmark tool. Practical, stable and fast performance testing framework.

## Property Based Testing

- Bla-bla.

## Rest API Testing

- Bla-bla.

## Static Checks

- Bla-bla.

## Test Runners

- Bla-bla.
