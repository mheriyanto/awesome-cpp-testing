## Code Coverage

- [Bullseye Coverage](https://www.bullseye.com/whatsNew.html#8_13) - is a code analyzer for C and C++ that evaluates how much of your source code was tested.
- [FrogLogic Coco](https://doc.froglogic.com/squish-coco/latest) - Coco tests code coverage for C, C++, C# and Tcl code.
- [Intel C++ Compiler 15.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/documentation.html) - displays dynamic execution counts for each basic block of the application, provides differential coverage data, and presents code coverage information visually with a customizable coloring scheme.
- [Testwell CTC++](https://www.testwell.fi/ctcdesc.html) - is a code coverage tool for C, C+, Java, and C#.

## Load Testing

- [Parasoft Jtest](https://parasoft.force.com) - provides a suite of testing tools for a variety of purposes like load testing, security testing, and more.

## Mock and Stub

- [CppUTest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest) - unit testing and mocking framework for C/C++.
- [mockcpp](https://github.com/sinojelly/mockcpp) - a jmock-like generic C/C++ Mock Framework, which doesn't use complex template technique which will result in very heavy compiling overhead.

## Mutation Testing

- [Dextool](https://github.com/joakim-brannstrom/dextool) - a framework for writing plugins using libclang. The main focus is tools for testing and static analysis.
- [MuCPP](https://ucase.uca.es/mucpp/#:~:text=MuCPP%20is%20a%20mutation%20testing,applied%20using%20the%20Clang%20compiler.) - is a mutation testing tool for the C++ programming language.
- [mull](https://github.com/mull-project/mull) - is a practical mutation testing tool for C and C++.
- [Mutate++](https://github.com/nlohmann/mutate_cpp) - C++ Mutation Test Environment.
- [Mut-tools](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/mut-tools-mutation-testing-for-cc-programs) - mutation testing for C/C++ programs.

## Performance Testing

- [sltbench](https://github.com/ivafanas/sltbench) - C++ benchmark tool. Practical, stable and fast performance testing framework.

## Property Based Testing

* [RapidCheck](https://github.com/emil-e/rapidcheck) - is a C++ framework for property based testing inspired by QuickCheck and other similar frameworks. In property based testing, you state facts about your code that given certain precondition should always be true.

## Static Checks

- [Cppcheck](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io) - is a popular, open-source, free, cross-platform static code analysis tool dedicated to C and C++. 
- [CppDepend](https://www.cppdepend.com) - is a commercial static code analysis tool for C++.
- [Klocwork](https://www.perforce.com/products/klocwork) - is a leader when it comes to C++ static code analysis tools.
- [Parasoft C/C++test](https://www.parasoft.com/products/parasoft-c-ctest) - targeting enterprise and embedded applications, includes a static code analysis tool (these industries are often required to obtain static code analysis tools for security reasons), as well as dynamic code analysis, unit test, code coverage, runtime analysis, and other functions.
- [PC-lint Plus](https://gimpel.com) - is a comprehensive static analysis solution for C and C++

## Testing Frameworks
